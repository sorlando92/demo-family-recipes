# demo-family-recipes
A fun project I have been working on to store recipes and demonstrate full stack capabilities. This project uses node.js for the backend along with Express Router and MongoDB. The front end uses standard Javascript, HTML, and CSS with EJS and Bootstrap to assist.

## Features
- Allows users to view recipes, authenticate / create logins, and add / edit recipes.
